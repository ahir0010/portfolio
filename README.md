## Introduction

Hello! This web portfolio shows what I did. I talk about how I did it, the problems I had, how I solved them, and what I learned.

## Process

First of all, coding is totally a new experience for me, I didn't really like coding at first, but now I'm enojoying it. Throughtout this course I've learned a lot!

## Challenges

The major challenges were to make a website responisve, and image optimization for me. To overcome these challenges I had to have a deep knowledge of CSS for responsiveness + picture tag for image optimization. I thoroughly understood, and learned the functionalities. Thanks to bootstrap which made this way too easier.

## Learning


1. **Planning:** Good planning and clear goals are important for a successful project.
2. **Flexibility:** Web development can have surprises, so being flexible helps solve problems.
3. **Making things better:** I also learned ways to make websites work faster and smoother for users.
